          <p>
            The &quot;Image Compressor from MB to kB&quot; is a free online tool
            that allows users to reduce the size of their image files by
            compressing them from megabytes (MB) to kilobytes (kB). The Service
            supports multiple image formats, including JPG, PNG, and WebP. It is
            designed for personal and non-commercial use, and no account
            registration is required to use the Service.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Service is provided on an &quot;as-is&quot; and

            about its performance or reliability. The Service may be modified,

            The design, layout, graphics, logos, and all other content and

          <p>
            When you upload an image to the Service, the image is processed on
            our servers for the sole purpose of compression. We do not inspect,
            modify, or analyze the contents of your images. The images are
            stored temporarily on our servers during the compression process and
            are deleted immediately upon completion.
          </p>
          <p>
            We respect your privacy and do not retain any image data beyond the
            time required to perform the compression. We do not share or sell
            your images to third parties, and the image data is processed
            securely using industry-standard encryption methods.
